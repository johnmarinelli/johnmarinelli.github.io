ive been reflecting on how social media influences my life ......

the internet is a new form of media, one that i and people my age have grown up with.  
its almost comically ironic that many of our liberal minded generation indulge in tropes and idioms of social media while disparaging "popular" media - television, magazines, whatever.

the internet IS the new popular media.  its so vast that we sometimes forget that, and its easy to think that our niche of the internet, whatever it is, is untainted by outside forces.

tl;dr: we know that media is poisonous, and social media is still media.  social media is poisonous. 

the revolution will not be televised (or snapchatted, instagrammed, or vined)

a simple axiom that i live by: dont trust anything that has ads.

*steps off of soapbox*
